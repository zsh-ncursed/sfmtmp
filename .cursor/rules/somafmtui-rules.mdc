# Somafm_tui rules

- If there are changes in the code that affect the application's display or its control, then after making the changes, you need to update the README.md file with the new information.
Project Requirements for Developers:

1. Always explore multiple solution options and choose the best one based on the following criteria:
   - **Functionality of the solution**: The solution must work correctly and meet all requirements.
   - **Code volume**: Less code is better, provided it does not compromise functionality or readability.
   - **Number of files**: Fewer files are preferable, though this is not a critical factor.

2. All project text, including comments and documentation, must be written in English.

3. Before submitting changes to GitHub, always test the code thoroughly to ensure its correctness and functionality.

4. If a problem arises, report it to the user with a clear and detailed description of the issue. 

By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure a streamlined, efficient, and high-quality development process.
